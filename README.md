## Broadcast Box
Media Streams Publish-Subscribe for Openfire using Broadcast Box.
This openfire plugin uses [Broadcast Box](https://github.com/Glimesh/broadcast-box) to implement a payload format for communicating user media streams using WebRTC-based ingestion/egress. The WebRTC SDP payload format is typically transported using the personal eventing protocol, a profile of XMPP publish-subscribe specified in XEP-0163.
