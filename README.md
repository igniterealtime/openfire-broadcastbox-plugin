## Orin Ayo
Orin Ayo in Yoruba means "Song of Joy". 

This openfire plugin uses native Java support for the RTP-MIDI protocol and  [Broadcast Box](https://github.com/Glimesh/broadcast-box) to implement a [payload format for communicating user media streams using WebRTC-based ingestion/egress](https://igniterealtime.github.io/openfire-orinayo-plugin/xep). The MIDI events and the WebRTC SDP payload format are transported using IQ stanzas and the personal eventing protocol, a profile of XMPP publish-subscribe specified in XEP-0163.
It also includes the [OrinAyo Web Client](https://github.com/Jus-Be/orin-ayo) which turns a Guitar Controller Device into a MIDI controller for Arranger Keyboards and Loopers.
The plugin ebables Openfire to be an XMPP based collaborative music platform by providing a Publish-Subscribe service for both MIDI events and music media streams.
