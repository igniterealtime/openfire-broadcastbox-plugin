Thank you for downloading the MOX performance styles for the PSR-E443!


*****************************************
Getting started
*****************************************

Each of the Yamaha Motif/MOX series workstations have hundreds of factory
"Performances" to be used for live performance, jamming or song-writing.
A Motif/MOX Performance consists of four independent voices, usually drum,
bass, and one or two other voices like guitar or piano. A Performance
includes five or six groups of related musical phrases, called "arpeggios."
Each group of arpeggios plays a role such as main section, fill or break.
The player switches between arpeggio groups while jamming or recording.
In this way, the musician can build up a full arrangement. The arpeggios
are drawn from an internal library of several thousand musical phrases,
some of which may already sound familiar to PSR/Tyros users.

The styles in this collection are translated from Motif/MOX Performances.
The styles play just like regular PSR/Tyros styles including fill-in sections.
Here are a few tips to help you use and enjoy these styles.

  * The original Performances are simple and stripped down -- no elaborate
    orchestrations to get in the way of song-writing. A few of the styles
    use only bass and drum! These are great for jamming since you have more
    freedom to elaborate on your own musical themes.

  * The introductions and endings are also very simple. Most introductions
    are just a short, one bar count in. Endings are simple "live" endings.

  * Don't be afraid to remix the styles or change the tempo.

  * The styles have four MAIN sections with corresponding fill-in sections.

PSR-E443 and other SFF1 arrangers
*****************************************

These styles are translated for and tested on the PSR-E443 arranger. They
should be fully compatible with the E433, too. Some of the styles use the
Power Kit and/or Cuban Kit, which are not available on earlier members of
the E4xx family or other entry-level arrangers. If that's the case, I suggest
using one of the marvelous tools from Jørgen Sørensen (Style Remixer or
Style Revoicer) or Michael P. Bedesem (MixMaster or MIDI Player) to change
the drum voices in Channel 9 and Channel 10.

The style files have four MAIN sections and four fill-in sections. The
PSR-E443 (and other entry-level arrangers) can only play the INTRO A,
INTRO B, MAIN A, MAIN B, ENDING A and ENDING B sections. If you would like
to hear or use the "hidden" sections, then download one of those tools that
I just mentioned and re-mix! 

Style files can be opened in a MIDI sequencer or DAW such as SONAR or
Cubase. Simply change the file extension from "STY" to "MID," then load
the .MID file into the editor. Editors ignore and drop non-MIDI data
like the style CASM section. You need to use a utility like Jørgen's
Style Split/Splice in order to preserve non-MIDI data when editing 
with a DAW.

The styles are SFF1 and they should play on any Yamaha arranger that can
handle SFF1. Again, you may need to re-voice the styles for your particular
arranger. I tried to use regular bass, piano and synth voices that are
available on the widest possible range of arrangers. 

These styles do not use MegaVoice bass or guitar.

The styles in this collection do not include OTS information. I omitted OTS
in order to keep the style file size small. You should be able to load
several styles at a time, even on a memory-limited arranger. Five styles
fit easily on a PSR-E443, for example.

If you have an arranger that supports MegaVoices, SFF GE (SFF2) and OTS, you
are more than welcome to load up these styles and use them! However, I have
a more advanced collection in development right now and you may wish to wait
for the next version.
