<section1 topic='Introduction' anchor='intro'> 
  <p>While WebRTC specifies the usage of SDPs [RFC8866] and an Offer/Answer model [RFC3264] for creating connections, WebRTC does not define the precise signaling protocols over which SDPs should be exchanged [RFC8825]. In order to establish a WebRTC session between two WebRTC entities, a signaling protocol is usually used to exchange SDPs</p>
  <p>With HTTP/S applications, WHIP and WHEP have been proposed as simple protocols to ingest and egress media streams using WebRTC.</p>
  <p>This specification defines a payload format for communicating user media streams using WebRTC-based ingestion/egress. The WebRTC SDP payload format is transported using set and get IQ stanzas which map directly to WHIP and WHEP.</p>
  <p>The personal eventing protocol, a profile of XMPP publish-subscribe specified in &xep0163; is used to auto-notify subscribers when media streams become available.</p>
</section1>
<section1 topic="Requirements" anchor="reqs">
  <ul>
    <li>Be as easy to implement as possible. This is grounded on the idea that most programming languages already have HTTP libraries available.</li>
    <li>Usable with WebRTC-based broadcasting providers that have no XMPP integration.</li>
    <li>Usable with XMPP client applications that may have no HTTP/S access to the WebRTC-based ingestion/egress service.</li>	
    <li>Anyone who knows the WHIP and WHEP REST Endpoints SHOULD be able to access it as well.</li>
  </ul>

<section1 topic="Discovering Support" anchor="disco">
  <section2 topic="Discovery Query" anchor="disco-initiation">
    <p>The server advertises support for WebRTC-based ingestion/egress, as specified by this protocol, by including the "urn:xmpp:whip:0" namespace, as well as "urn:xmpp:whep:0" namespaces in its service discovery information features as specified in in &xep0030;.</p>
    <p>If the server can push ice candidates patches from the WebRTC-based ingestion/egress, it SHOULD include 'urn:xmpp:whip:ice:0' and 'urn:xmpp:whep:ice:0' namespaces. If the WebRTC-based egress supports extensions, then it SHOULD also include the 'urn:xmpp:whep:ext:0' namespace. </p>
