<section1 topic='Introduction' anchor='intro'> 
  <p>While WebRTC specifies the usage of SDPs [RFC8866] and an Offer/Answer model [RFC3264] for creating connections, WebRTC does not define the precise signaling protocols over which SDPs should be exchanged [RFC8825]. In order to establish a WebRTC session between two WebRTC entities, a signaling protocol is usually used to exchange SDPs</p>
  <p>With HTTP/S applications, WHIP and WHEP have been proposed as simple protocols to ingest and egress media streams using WebRTC.</p>
  <p>This specification defines a payload format for communicating user media streams using WebRTC-based ingestion/egress. The WebRTC SDP payload format is transported using set and get IQ stanzas which map directly to WHIP and WHEP.</p>
  <p>The personal eventing protocol, a profile of XMPP publish-subscribe specified in XEP-0163 is used to auto-notify subscribers when media streams become available.</p>
</section1>
<section1 topic="Requirements" anchor="reqs">
  <ul>
    <li>Be as easy to implement as possible. This is grounded on the idea that most programming languages already have HTTP libraries available.</li>
    <li>Usable with WebRTC-based broadcasting providers that have no XMPP integration.</li>
    <li>Anyone who knows the WHIP and WHEP REST Endpoints SHOULD be able to access it as well.</li>
  </ul>
</section1>
<section1 topic="Discovering Support" anchor="disco">
  <section2 topic="Discovery Query" anchor="disco-initiation">
    <p>The server advertises support for WebRTC-based ingestion/egress, as specified by this protocol, by including the "urn:xmpp:sdp:whip:0" namespace, as well as "urn:xmpp:sdp:whep:0" namespaces in its service discovery information features as specified in <span class="ref"><link url="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0030.html">Service Discovery (XEP-0030)</link></span> <note>XEP-0030: Service Discovery &lt;<link url="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0030.html">https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0030.html</link>&gt;.</note> or section 6.3 of <span class="ref"><link url="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0115.html">Entity Capabilities (XEP-0115)</link></span> <note>XEP-0115: Entity Capabilities &lt;<link url="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0115.html">https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0115.html</link>&gt;.</note>.</p>
    <p>If the server can push ice candidates patches from the WebRTC-based ingestion/egress, it SHOULD include 'urn:xmpp:sdp:ice:0' namespace. If the WebRTC-based egress supports server-sent events (SSE), then it SHOULD also include the 'urn:xmpp:sdp:whep:sse:0' namespace. </p>
